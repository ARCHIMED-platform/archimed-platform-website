I am a researcher working at CIRAD in the AMAP lab in Montpellier, France. I am specialized in Functional-Structural Plant Modelling (FSPM). I develop  ARCHIMED since the 2000's and used it to simulate *e.g.* coffee trees and palm plants (mainly coco and oil palms) water, energy and carbon fluxes, or even the impact of solar panels on crops.
