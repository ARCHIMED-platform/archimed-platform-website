I am a researcher working at CIRAD in the AGAP lab in Montpellier, France. I am specialized in plant ecophysiology and modelling. I used ARCHIMED during my PhD to simulate the light interception and assimilation of oil palms. We have a tight collaboration with the FSPM team of AMAP for modelling oil palms in their environment, noteably in the [PalmStudio project]({{< ref "/project/PalmStudio/index.md" >}}).
