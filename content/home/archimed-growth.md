# ARCHIMED-γ 

--- 

ARCHIMED-γ (pronounced ARCHIMED-growth) is part of the ARCHIMED modeling platform and is used to simulate the plant development, growth and yield. It is not yet available as a module of the ARCHIMED platform. It is scattered into different softwares aimed at different questions. We are putting a lot of thinking into providing a single software that does all, aiming at providing a generic software for developpers and users where each plant could simply been parameterized using botanic knowledge. This approach would be inspired by the way a plant is considered in the [STICS](https://www6.paca.inrae.fr/stics_eng/) model (i.e. it is parameterized once and for all).
